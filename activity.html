                  ESPRE workshop was held at RE'18 in Banff. Yijun Yu and Lionel
                  Briand gave very interesting keynote speeches on adaptive
                  security and privacy requirements, and modeling security and
                  privacy requirements to enable test automation, respectively.
                  Thanks to all of you co-organizers, PC members and

                  <b>Abstract</b><br />Behavioral, situational and environmental
                  changes in complex software, such as robot software, cannot be
                  completely captured in software design. To handle this
                  dynamism, self-managed software enables its services
                  dynamically adapted to various situations by reconfiguring its
                  software architecture during run-time. We have developed a
                  practical framework, called SHAGE (Self-Healing, Adaptive, and
                  Growing SoftwarE), to support self-managed software for
                  intelligent service robots. The SAHGE framework is composed of
                  six main elements: a situation monitor to identify internal
                  and external conditions of a software system, ontology-based
                  models to describe architecture and components, brokers to
                  find appropriate architectural reconfiguration patterns and
                  components for a situation, a reconfigurator to actually
                  change the architecture based on the selected reconfiguration
                  pattern and components, a decision maker/learner to find the
                  optimal solution of reconfiguring software architecture for a
                  situation, and repositories to effectively manage and share
                  architectural reconfiguration patterns, components, and
                  problem solving strategies. We conducted an experiment of
                  applying the framework to an infotainment robot. The result of
                  the experiment shows the practicality and usefulness of the
                  framework for the intelligent service robots.

                  Software Assurance: Requirements Engineering Approach<br>
                  Presented by Dr. Seok-Won Lee and Robin Gandhi<br>
                  3:00PM on Friday, March 31, 2006, 106 Woodward Hall :<br>
                  Abstract:</b> In the first part of our talk, we discuss recent efforts from the Department of Homeland Security to create a common body of knowledge for software assurance. We then move on to elaborate on the theoretical backgrounds behind our approach that motivate the need for the definition of a common language in the problem domain to address the issues related to software assurance. In the second part, we discuss our efforts on establishing secure systems assurance based on Certification and Accreditation activities, that include effective ways to understand the enforced organizational security requirements, gather relevant evidences, perceive related risks in the operational environment, and reveal their causal relationships with other domain concepts. </p>

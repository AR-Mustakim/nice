                  This research contributes to a foundational theory for
                  understanding and reasoning about risks that arise due to
                  cascading effects of a failure in software system features
                  regulated by certification requirements. Emergent risks are
                  difficult to understand and assess based on evidence that only
                  evaluates the compliance of individual system features. This
                  research work establishes a fundamental understanding of
                  regulatory requirements, their compliance evidences and their
                  relationships with risk in the context of system operational
                  needs.<br />

                  Risks in a complex system most often arise due to cascading
                  effects of a failure (e.g. weakest link syndrome) among
                  constraints that collectively contribute to dependability as
                  an emergent property of the system as a whole. To assess these
                  risks, we leverage the semantics of each C&A requirement
                  explicated by its relationships with multi-dimensional
                  concepts in the PDO. Within a bounded and situated scope for
                  risk assessment, correlations among C&A requirements that
                  represent different classes of security constraints are
                  discovered and understood by applying the algebraic model of
                  Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) along with the semantics learned
                  from the PDO. The resulting formal concept lattice, natural
                  language risk explanations, and well-defined risk metrics and
                  measures based on the theory of FCA help to significantly
                  improve the quality of risk assessment artifacts resulting
                  from the C&A process.<br />

                  The associated methodology provides certification analysts
                  with methods and techniques to systematically discover an
                  exhaustive set of applicable C&A requirements in a given
                  scenario of system operation and construct an algebraic model
                  of all potential correlations among them that may lead to a
                  cascading failure in system defenses. Tool support for this
                  methodology is implemented in a prototype workbench,
                  r-AnalytiCA, which enables several meaningful insights for
                  software assurance during the C&A process. A well-designed
                  case-study with real-world C&A experts was conducted to
                  evaluate the claims made through our research

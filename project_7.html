                  <b>Description: </b>DITSCAP (The DoD Information Technology
                  Security Certification and Accreditation Process, DoD
                  Directive 5200.40) is the standard C&A (Certification and
                  Accreditation) Process for the Department of Defense. The
                  DITSCAP establishes a standard process, set of activities,
                  general tasks, and a management structure to certify and
                  accredit information system (IS) that will maintain the
                  information assurance (IA) and security posture of the Defense
                  Information Infrastructure (DII). This process supports an
                  infrastructure-centric approach, with a focus on the mission,
                  environment, and architecture. For a system in development,
                  the intent is to identify appropriate security requirements,
                  design to meet those requirements, test the design against the
                  same requirements, and then monitor the accredited system for
                  changes or reaccredidation as necessary. In this project, we
                  identify the missing components and limitations in the current
                  DITSCAP practice such as: 1.Long and exhaustive process of
                  self-checks and documentation; 2.Requiring extensive resources
                  to conduct, manage, and maintain; and 3.Lack of an organized
                  methodology to gather and analyze the necessary information,
                  and investigate how to improve the entire DITSCAP practice
                  through an automated system support. To address these issues
                  and enhance the effectiveness of DITSCAP, our design
                  principles, modeling techniques and supporting theoretical
                  foundations lead to the conceptualization and design of the
                  DITSCAP-Automation Tool (DITSCAP-AT). DITSCAP-AT aggregates
                  and analyzes C&A related information from various sources,
                  using a uniform representation scheme and transforms static
                  record keeping repositories into active ones that link to each
                  other from different perspectives, allowing for their reuse
                  and evolution through all the stages of the system lifecycle.
                  DITSCAP-AT leverages the expressiveness of object oriented
                  ontologies as its primary modeling method for information
                  representation and analysis that provides active assistance in
                  performing analysis to discover possible missing, conflicting,
                  inconsistent, incomplete or overlapping information.
